a "key window" is the one which currently receives keyboard events.
a "main window" is the one highlighted.

"key window" and "main window" are usually the same. exceptions are small
dialogs which affect the main window, ie. a save file dialog.

an example for a window which doesn't become a key window is NSPanel.
