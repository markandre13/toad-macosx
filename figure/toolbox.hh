 * TToolBox provides a collection of TFigureTools to TFigureEditor.
 *
 * A TFigureEditor has one TToolBox, while a TToolBox may be assigned to
 * many TFigureEditors.
 *
 * One TFigureTool within TToolBox is the active tool, to which
 * TFigureEditor will delegate all edit events.
 *
 * When the pointing device provides an ID, as is the case with some graphic
 * tablet pens, TToolBox will also maintain a separate active tool per pen.
